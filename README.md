# Control-Systems-and-Bio-Robotics

- Used MATLAB and Simulink exclusively for all projects.

- Performed various tasks such as system modeling, simulation, analysis and classical-controller designs of linear, time-invariant, continuous time systems. 

- Investigated system dynamic properties in time and frequency domains, performance specifications and basic properties of feedback.

- Reinforced stability analysis through Routh-Hurwitz criterion, Root-Locus method, Bode plots, and Nyquist criteria. Performed basic tasks on state-space representation and feedback.

- Worked on the following projects:
  - Transient Response and Stability in 2nd and 3rd Order Systems.
  - Transfer Function Modeling of DC Motors and Lead and Lag Compensators.
  - Transfer Function Modeling of Physical Systems and Control (DC Motors)
  - PI, PD, PID Controllers and System Stability.
