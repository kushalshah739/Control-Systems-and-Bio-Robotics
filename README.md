# Control-Systems-and-Bio-Robotics
Performed various tasks such as system modeling, simulation, analysis and classical-controller designs of linear, time-invariant, continuous time systems. System dynamic properties in time and frequency domains, performance specifications and basic properties of feedback are investigated. Stability analysis is reinforced through Routh-Hurwitz criterion, Root-Locus method, Bode plots, and Nyquist criteria. Concept of Bio-Robotics is introduced, and exposure to basics of state-space representation and feedback.
