# Control-Systems-and-Bio-Robotics

- Performed various tasks such as system modeling, simulation, analysis and classical-controller designs of linear, time-invariant, continuous time systems. 

- Investigated system dynamic properties in time and frequency domains, performance specifications and basic properties of feedback.

- Stability analysis is reinforced through Routh-Hurwitz criterion, Root-Locus method, Bode plots, and Nyquist criteria. Performed basic tasks on state-space   representation and feedback.
